    question: "How do I calculate average per day?",
    answer:
      "Divide the total by the number of days in the period: average per day = total ÷ days. Enter a total and a duration in days, weeks, months, or years — or a start and end date. Months use 365 ÷ 12 days and years use 365 days. The calculator shows the daily figure and a one-line worked step.",
  },

  {
    question: "How does the average per day between two dates work?",
    answer:
      "Pick Date range, enter the start and end dates, and choose whether to include the end date. Inclusive counting adds one day so both endpoints count; turning the toggle off uses the span without the end date. The total is then divided by that day count.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a daily average calculator useful for?",
    answer:
      "Use it for a cost per day, spend pace, distance per day, points per day, or any total you want to spread evenly across a period. Optional unit labels (such as USD or km) appear as plain text beside the results.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I find an average per week or per month?",
    answer:
      "After you have a daily average, the “at the same pace” section multiplies by 7 for a weekly figure, by 365 ÷ 12 for a monthly figure, and by 365 for a yearly figure. Those are steady-pace projections, not a separate calendar model.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I calculate a cost per day?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Enter the total cost as the amount, set the period in days or dates, and optionally type a short unit label such as USD. The large result is the cost per day; week, month, and year pace figures follow from that daily rate.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does “Per working day only” do?",
    answer:
      "When you use a date range, that toggle counts business days with the shared weekend and holiday options instead of every calendar day. Configure non-working weekdays and optional public holidays under More options. It is not available when you enter a duration in days, weeks, months, or years.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I turn a daily average into a total?",
    answer:
      "Choose Find the total, enter the daily average, and set the period (a duration in days, weeks, months, or years — or a date range). The result is daily average × number of days. Example: 40 per day × 30 days = 1,200.",
  },

  {
    question: "Is this the same as the Average Calculator?",
    answer:
      "No. The Average Calculator finds mean, median, mode, and related stats from a list of numbers. This tool spreads one total across days (or builds a total from a daily rate). For a list average, use the Average Calculator; for how many calendar days fall between two dates alone, use Days Between Two Dates.",

                How the Daily Average Is Calculated
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-2 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted">
                The arithmetic is straightforward; the date options only change
                how many days land in the divisor or multiplier.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted">
              <p>
                For a daily average, divide the total by the day count. Example:
                1,200 ÷ 30 days = 40 per day. For a total from a daily rate,
                multiply instead: 40 per day × 30 days = 1,200.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a date range, the day count follows local calendar dates
                (no UTC conversion). Including the end date counts both
                endpoints — so 1 January through 10 January is 10 days. Leaving
                the end date out yields 9 days for that same pair. If you enable
                working days only, weekends and any selected holidays are skipped
                using the same business-day module as the{" "}

              <p>
                Week, month, and year rows scale the daily figure by 7, by 365 ÷
                12, and by 365. They assume a steady pace so you can compare a
                cost per day or other daily rate to longer horizons. They are
                not a promise about which calendar months have 28, 30, or 31
                days.
