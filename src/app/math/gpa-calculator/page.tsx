  {
    question: "How do I calculate my GPA?",
    answer:
      "Enter each course grade and credit hours. The calculator multiplies grade points by credits for every graded course, adds those quality points, and divides by total credits counted. Pass/fail and withdrawn marks on US-style scales are left out. The result updates as you type, with a one-line worked step under the CGPA.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between GPA, SGPA and CGPA?",
    answer:
      "GPA is the general grade-point average. SGPA is the GPA for a single semester (or term). CGPA is the cumulative average across all semesters and credits counted so far. This page shows SGPA for each semester block and an overall CGPA.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I calculate CGPA from multiple semesters?",
    answer:
      "Add a semester block for each term, enter courses and credits, then read the overall CGPA in the result panel. CGPA weights every graded credit across semesters: total quality points ÷ total credits. You can also turn on “Include previous cumulative GPA / CGPA” if you only know an earlier CGPA and credit total.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between weighted and unweighted GPA?",
    answer:
      "Unweighted GPA uses the plain letter-to-points scale. Weighted GPA adds extra points for harder courses — here, Honors adds 0.5 and AP/IB adds 1.0 on passing grades (failing grades stay 0). Weighting is offered on US-style 4.0 / 4.3 scales. Schools set their own rules, so treat this as a helpful estimate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I convert CGPA to percentage?",
    answer:
      "There is no universal formula. Many Indian universities using a 10-point scale publish a conversion such as percentage ≈ CGPA × 9.5, but others use different factors or tables. When the 10-point scale is selected, this calculator shows an editable conversion factor (default 9.5) and labels the percentage as an estimate. Always follow your institution’s official method for applications and transcripts.",
  },
  {
    question: "What GPA do I need to reach my target CGPA?",
    answer:
      "Open the Target CGPA planner and enter your current CGPA, credits completed, credits still to take, and target. The tool solves for the GPA needed on remaining credits: (target × (done + left) − current × done) ÷ left. If that value is above your scale’s maximum, the target is not reachable with the credits left.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which grading scale does my university use?",
    answer:
      "Only your institution’s published grade-point table is authoritative. Common patterns include US 4.0 with plus/minus, 4.0 with thirds, 5.0 letter scales, and 10-point CGPA systems. Pick the closest preset here or build a Custom scale, then confirm against your handbook or registrar.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does an A+ count as 4.0 or 4.3?",
    answer:
      "It depends on the school. Some cap A+ at 4.0; others use 4.3. Use the grade-scale selector on this page to match your institution’s published scale.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are pass/fail and withdrawn courses handled?",
    answer:
      "On US-style scales, P, NP, and W are excluded from both quality points and credits. On custom scales you can mark grades as excluded. Uncheck Include on a row to omit an older attempt after a retake when your policy allows it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a good GPA?",
    answer:
      "On a 4.0 scale, many colleges treat about 3.0 as solid (B average), 3.5+ as strong, and 3.7–4.0 as excellent — but “good” depends on your program, scholarships, and goals. On 5.0 or 10-point scales, compare against your university’s class average and published cutoffs instead of US letter bands.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my school's official GPA match this result?",
    answer:
      "Not always. Registrars may use different point values, rounding, repeated-course rules, or weighting. Use this tool to plan and estimate, then confirm against your transcript or school GPA policy.",

              <p className="mt-2 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted">
                For each graded course, multiply the grade’s point value by the
                course credits to get quality points. SGPA for one semester is
                that semester’s total quality points divided by its credits.
                CGPA across semesters (or a whole degree) uses the same idea on
                all counted credits: total quality points ÷ total credits.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted">
                Example: Semester 1 has a 3-credit A (4.0) and a 3-credit B
                (3.0) → (4.0×3) + (3.0×3) = 21 quality points over 6 credits →
                SGPA = 21 ÷ 6 = 3.50. Semester 2 adds 6 credits at SGPA 3.00 (18
                quality points). Combined CGPA = (21 + 18) ÷ (6 + 6) = 39 ÷ 12 =
                3.25.

                Unweighted GPA treats every course the same on the letter scale.
                Weighted GPA gives extra points for advanced classes so an A in
                AP can outrank an A in a regular course. This calculator’s
                default weighting (on US-style scales) adds 0.5 for Honors and
                1.0 for AP/IB on passing grades only; failing grades remain 0.
                Many high schools and colleges publish their own tables — always
                prefer your school’s policy for official transcripts.

                How to Convert CGPA to Percentage
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-2 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted">
                Conversion methods vary by institution. Some universities on a
                10-point scale use a factor such as percentage ≈ CGPA × 9.5;
                others publish a different multiplier or a lookup table. No
                single formula is universal for 4.0 or 5.0 scales either. When
                you select the 10-point scale above, the result panel offers an
                editable conversion factor (default 9.5) and clearly labels the
                percentage as an estimate — use your registrar’s official rule
                for applications and certificates.
