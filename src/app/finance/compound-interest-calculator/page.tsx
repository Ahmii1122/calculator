    question: "How do I calculate compound interest?",
    answer:
      "Choose an assumed annual rate and compounding frequency, then apply A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) for a lump sum, or add regular contributions month by month. This compound interest calculator runs that simulation live as you change the inputs.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the compound interest formula?",
    answer:
      "The basic compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the future value, P is the starting principal, r is the annual rate as a decimal, n is how many times interest compounds per year, and t is time in years. Regular contributions add a separate month-by-month term.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between simple and compound interest?",
    answer:
      "Simple interest is earned only on the original principal. Compound interest is earned on the principal plus interest already credited, so the balance can grow faster over the same rate and time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does compounding more often make a big difference?",
    answer:
      "Daily or monthly compounding usually produces a slightly higher effective annual yield than yearly compounding at the same nominal rate. The gap is often small compared with the effect of the rate you assume and how long the money stays invested.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is APY, and how is it different from the interest rate?",
    answer:
      "The interest rate is the nominal annual rate you enter. APY (effective annual yield) folds in compounding: APY = (1 + r/n)^n − 1. Comparing APYs is a clearer way to compare how often interest is credited.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the rule of 72 work?",
    answer:
      "The rule of 72 is a quick approximation: divide 72 by the annual percentage return to estimate years to double. This page also shows a more precise estimate using ln(2) ÷ ln(1 + APY), still ignoring contributions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this calculator guarantee these returns?",
    answer:
      "No. The rate is an assumption you choose. Real investment returns vary, are not constant, and can be negative. Treat the future value as an illustration, not a prediction or promise.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Why does the future value change when contributions are made at the start of the period?",
    answer:
      "Contributions at the beginning of each period start earning interest sooner than contributions at the end. Over many periods that timing difference adds up, so the same contribution amount produces a higher ending balance when paid at the start.",
  },

                The Compound Interest Formula

                How to calculate compound interest for a lump sum, then

              <p>
                The standard compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt).
                A is the future value, P is the principal, r is the annual rate
                as a decimal, n is the number of compounding periods per year,
                and t is time in years. Example: 10,000 at 5% compounded
                annually for 10 years is 10,000 × (1.05)^10 ≈ 16,288.95. The
                same amount compounded monthly is about 16,470.09.
              </p>
              <p>
                When you add regular contributions, there is no single short
                formula that covers every frequency and timing mix, so this
                investment growth calculator (a future value calculator with
                deposits) adds each contribution on the months it falls due and
                grows the balance with an equivalent monthly factor derived
                from the nominal rate and compounding frequency.

                5% compounded annually, the same starting amount ends near
                16,288.95 because each year&apos;s interest is added to the
                base that earns later interest. The gap widens as time or the
