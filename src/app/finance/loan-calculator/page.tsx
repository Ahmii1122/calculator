    question: "How do I calculate my monthly loan payment?",
    answer:
      "For a fixed-rate reducing-balance loan, the monthly payment depends on the loan amount, the annual interest rate, and the number of months. This loan calculator uses the standard EMI formula and shows the payment live as you change the inputs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is EMI calculated?",
    answer:
      "EMI (equated monthly installment) on a reducing-balance loan equals P × r × (1 + r)^n ÷ ((1 + r)^n − 1), where P is the principal, r is the monthly rate, and n is the number of months. If the rate is zero, EMI is simply the principal divided by n.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is an amortization schedule?",
    answer:
      "An amortization schedule lists each payment and splits it into principal and interest, with the remaining balance after that payment. Early payments are usually mostly interest; later payments are mostly principal.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a flat rate and a reducing balance rate?",
    answer:
      "A reducing-balance rate charges interest on the remaining principal each month. A flat rate charges interest on the original amount for the whole term, then divides principal plus that interest into equal payments. Flat-rate quotes can look lower than they are; the equivalent reducing-balance rate is often higher.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do extra payments affect my loan?",
    answer:
      "Extra amounts applied to principal can shorten the schedule and reduce total interest. Some lenders charge prepayment fees, so check your loan terms before paying ahead.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the interest rate here the same as APR?",
    answer:
      "No. This calculator uses the stated annual interest rate with monthly compounding. APR can include fees and other costs, so a lender’s APR may be higher than the interest rate alone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is most of my early payment interest?",
    answer:
      "At the start of an amortizing loan the balance is highest, so the interest portion of each payment is largest. As the balance falls, more of each payment goes to principal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my lender's numbers match this calculator?",
    answer:
      "They may differ slightly because of rounding, fees, payment timing, and day-count conventions. Treat these figures as estimates and confirm the schedule with your lender.",

                With monthly rate r = annual rate ÷ 12 ÷ 100 and n months, the
                payment is P × r × (1 + r)^n ÷ ((1 + r)^n − 1). If the rate is
                zero, the payment is simply P ÷ n. That is the same EMI
                calculation formula used for many personal loan and car loan
                payment estimates when the rate is fixed and installments are
                monthly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Example: 100,000 at 6% for 30 years (360 months) has r = 0.005
                and a monthly payment of about 599.55. Early payments are mostly
                interest; later payments are mostly principal. This loan payment
                calculator assumes a fixed rate and equal monthly installments —
                not a variable rate or irregular payment plan.

                An amortization schedule shows how each installment is split and
                how the balance falls over time. A loan amortization schedule is
                useful when you want to see the payoff path, not only the
                monthly payment. The yearly view summarizes principal and
                interest per year; expanding a year shows each month. The same
                structure applies to a personal loan calculator, car loan
                calculator, or auto loan calculator scenario — the math is the
                same for any fixed-rate installment loan.

                Reducing balance (standard EMI) recalculates interest on the
                remaining principal each month. Flat rate multiplies the
                original amount by the annual rate and the term in years, then
                divides principal plus that interest into equal payments.
                Flat-rate quotes can look lower than a comparable reducing rate
                because interest is charged on the full original amount; the
                estimated equivalent reducing-balance rate is usually higher.

                Extra monthly amounts applied to principal can cut the number of
                payments and the total interest compared with the baseline
                schedule. An extra payment calculator view (or pay off loan early
                calculator scenario) compares months saved and interest saved
                against the same loan with no extras. Some lenders charge
                prepayment fees or limit how extras are applied — check the loan
                terms before relying on an early-payoff plan.
