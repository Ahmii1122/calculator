    question: "How do I convert salary to hourly pay?",
    answer:
      "Enter your yearly (or other period) amount, choose that pay period, and set hours per week and weeks worked per year. The hourly rate is yearly pay ÷ (hours per week × weeks worked). Example: 60,000 per year at 40 hours and 52 weeks is about 28.85 per hour.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I convert hourly wage to a yearly salary?",
    answer:
      "Choose Hourly as the pay period, enter the hourly amount, hours per week, and weeks worked per year. Yearly pay = hourly × hours per week × weeks worked. Example: 20 × 40 × 52 = 41,600 per year.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do bi-weekly and semi-monthly pay differ?",
    answer:
      "Bi-weekly means every two weeks (26 times in a 52-week year), so that amount is weekly × 2. Semi-monthly means twice a month (24 times a year), so it is yearly ÷ 24. The same yearly gross therefore produces different bi-weekly and semi-monthly figures.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between weekly and bi-weekly pay?",
    answer:
      "Weekly is one week of gross pay. Bi-weekly (every two weeks) is two weeks of that same weekly amount. This calculator derives weekly from yearly ÷ weeks worked, then multiplies by two for bi-weekly.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does unpaid time off change the result?",
    answer:
      "Weeks worked per year defaults to 52. Optional unpaid weeks off are subtracted from that figure before conversions that use weeks (hourly, daily, weekly, and bi-weekly paths). Paid leave that still counts as worked time is not modeled here.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this include taxes or overtime?",
    answer:
      "No. Results are gross pay estimates only. Taxes, deductions, overtime premiums, bonuses, benefits, and employer-specific rules are not included. Employers may calculate pay differently from these simple period conversions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I convert monthly salary to a daily wage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Enter the monthly amount with the Monthly period. The tool converts to yearly first (monthly × 12), then derives weekly and daily (weekly ÷ days per week). Adjust days per week if your schedule is not five days.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this the same as a loan or savings calculator?",
    answer:
      "No. This page only converts a pay amount between common periods. For loan payments see the Loan Calculator; for how much to save toward a goal see the Savings Goal Calculator; for percent of a number see the Percentage Calculator.",

                How Salary and Hourly Pay Are Converted
              </h2>
              <p className="mt-2 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted">
                Every input is turned into a yearly gross figure first. The other
                periods are then derived from that yearly amount so the table
                stays consistent.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div className="max-w-3xl space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed text-muted">
              <p>
                From hourly pay: yearly = hourly × hours per week × weeks
                worked. From yearly salary: hourly = yearly ÷ (hours per week ×
                weeks worked). Weekly = yearly ÷ weeks worked; bi-weekly =
                weekly × 2; semi-monthly = yearly ÷ 24; monthly = yearly ÷ 12;
                quarterly = yearly ÷ 4; daily = weekly ÷ days per week.
              </p>
              <p>
                Worked example: 20 per hour, 40 hours per week, and 52 weeks
                gives 20 × 40 × 52 = 41,600 per year. That same schedule shows
                weekly 800, bi-weekly 1,600, semi-monthly about 1,733.33, monthly
                about 3,466.67, quarterly 10,400, and daily 160 (at five days per
                week). A 60,000 yearly salary at the same hours and weeks is about
                28.85 per hour.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bi-weekly and semi-monthly are easy to confuse. Every two weeks
                lands 26 times in a 52-week year; twice a month lands 24 times.
                That is why the two amounts differ for the same yearly gross.
              </p>
              <p>
                These conversions are arithmetic estimates of gross pay. They do
                not apply tax withholding, statutory deductions, overtime rules,
                bonuses, benefits, or unpaid leave policies beyond the optional
                unpaid-weeks field. Employers and payroll systems may use
                different conventions.
