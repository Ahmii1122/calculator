    question: "How do I calculate how much to save each month?",
    answer:
      "Divide the amount you still need by the number of months, or use a savings plan that includes an assumed interest rate. This savings goal calculator solves for the monthly amount from your goal, time frame, starting balance, and rate.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take me to save a certain amount?",
    answer:
      "With a fixed monthly contribution, the time depends on the goal, what you already have, and any interest you assume. Mode two of this monthly savings calculator reports whole months, rounded up so the balance is at or above the target.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the interest rate make a big difference?",
    answer:
      "At higher rates and longer time frames, interest can reduce the monthly amount needed or shorten the wait. At low rates the change is often small, so the contribution does most of the work. The rate here is an assumption you choose.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I include inflation in my savings goal?",
    answer:
      "Optional. If your goal is far ahead and you want it to keep today’s purchasing power, turn on the inflation adjustment so the calculator targets a larger future amount. Leave it off if you prefer to plan in today’s numbers only.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the difference between contributions at the start and end of the month?",
    answer:
      "Contributions at the beginning of each month start earning interest sooner than contributions at the end. Over many months that timing can slightly change the required amount or the time to the goal.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already have some savings?",
    answer:
      "Enter them as the starting amount. The calculator only plans for the remaining gap. If the starting amount already meets the goal, the required monthly saving is zero.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will my bank's numbers match this calculator?",
    answer:
      "They may differ slightly because of how interest is credited, fees, minimum balances, and rate changes. Treat these figures as estimates and confirm details with your own account terms.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I cannot save the full amount each month?",
    answer:
      "You can try a longer time frame or a smaller goal in the calculator to see other plans. There is no single right amount — choose what fits your situation, or talk with a qualified adviser.",

                How Much to Save Each Month
              </h2>

                The monthly amount needed for a fixed goal and deadline.

              <p>
                Without interest, how much you need to save per month is simply
                the remaining gap divided by the number of months. Example: a
                10,000 goal with nothing saved yet and 10 months means 1,000
                each month. With interest, the same goal over a longer span can
                need a smaller deposit because each contribution can earn a
                little before the deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Example with interest: 10,000, start 0, 5% compounded monthly,
                5 years, contributions at month-end — about 147.05 per month.
                That is lower than saving the same 10,000 with no interest over
                60 months (about 166.67), because interest covers part of the
                gap.

                Enter the goal, your monthly contribution, and any starting
                balance. Example: 10,000 with 200 each month and 0% interest
                takes 50 months. At 5% compounded monthly the exact solution is
                about 45.5 months, so the calculator rounds up to 46 months and
                checks the balance month by month so the reported month is the
                first one at or above the target.

                The gap is noticeable here, but at very low rates the monthly
                change is small — the contribution still does most of the work.
                Interest is never guaranteed; it is only an assumption in the
